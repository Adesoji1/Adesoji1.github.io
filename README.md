### Hugging Face

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a platform that provides state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. On my website, I leverage Hugging Face's models to enhance various functionalities and bring cutting-edge capabilities to my projects.

### ResNet50 and VGG16

I utilize two powerful image classification models, [ResNet50](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/) and [VGG16](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_vgg/), to process and analyze images. These models, based on deep convolutional neural networks, enable advanced image recognition and feature extraction.
